# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building an AI agent using the Strands SDK that automatically monitors Google news for Generative AI content from the last 72 hours, generates intelligent summaries, and distributes them to subscribers via AWS SNS. The system will run on AWS infrastructure and provide timely, relevant AI news updates to stakeholders.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a stakeholder interested in Generative AI developments, I want to receive automated summaries of the latest news, so that I can stay informed without manually searching for updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL retrieve news articles from Google related to "Generative AI" from the last 72 hours
2. WHEN news articles are retrieved THEN the system SHALL filter out duplicate or irrelevant content
3. WHEN valid articles are found THEN the system SHALL generate a coherent summary using AI capabilities
4. WHEN a summary is generated THEN the system SHALL publish it to the designated SNS topic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI agent to run reliably on AWS infrastructure, so that news summaries are delivered consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL run on AWS infrastructure using appropriate services
2. WHEN choosing AWS services THEN the system SHALL prefer serverless options where possible
3. WHEN scheduled THEN the system SHALL execute automatically at regular intervals
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and log appropriate information
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL use the Python-based Strands SDK for AI agent functionality
6. WHEN implementing THEN the system SHALL be written in Python to leverage the Strands SDK capabilities
7. WHEN configuring the Strands agent THEN it SHALL use Amazon Nova models through AWS Bedrock for news summarization capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a subscriber, I want to receive news summaries via email through SNS, so that I can access the information in my preferred communication channel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SNS topic is created THEN it SHALL be configured to deliver messages via email
2. WHEN rob.w.walker@gmail.com subscribes THEN they SHALL receive all published summaries
3. WHEN robert.walker2@regions.com subscribes THEN they SHALL receive all published summaries
4. WHEN a summary is published THEN all subscribers SHALL receive the message within a reasonable timeframe

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want the news summaries to be well-structured and informative, so that I can quickly understand the key developments in Generative AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL include key points from multiple relevant articles
2. WHEN creating content THEN the summary SHALL be concise yet comprehensive
3. WHEN formatting output THEN the summary SHALL include article sources and publication dates
4. WHEN no relevant news is found THEN the system SHALL send an appropriate notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the AWS infrastructure to be deployed using Terraform, so that the deployment is reproducible, version-controlled, and follows infrastructure-as-code best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use Terraform configuration files
2. WHEN provisioning resources THEN all AWS services SHALL be defined in Terraform modules
3. WHEN updating infrastructure THEN changes SHALL be applied through Terraform state management
4. WHEN documenting deployment THEN Terraform configuration SHALL include appropriate variable definitions and outputs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the solution to be cost-effective and secure, so that it can run sustainably without compromising data or incurring excessive costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL follow AWS security best practices
3. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary resource usage
4. WHEN handling subscriber information THEN the system SHALL protect personal data appropriately
5. WHEN deploying AWS infrastructure THEN all resources SHALL be configured to meet CIS (Center for Internet Security) compliance standards

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want all Python code execution to follow consistent environment practices, so that development, testing, and debugging are reliable and reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing any Python command THEN it SHALL be run through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2. WHEN running Python commands THEN the virtual environment located at `venv/` SHALL be activated first
3. WHEN calling Python THEN the command SHALL use `python3` explicitly, not just `python`
4. WHEN running tests THEN the command SHALL follow the pattern: `wsl bash -c "source venv/bin/activate && python3 -m pytest [test-path] -v"`
5. WHEN installing packages THEN the command SHALL follow the pattern: `wsl bash -c "source venv/bin/activate && pip install [package-name]"`
6. WHEN executing Python scripts THEN the command SHALL follow the pattern: `wsl bash -c "source venv/bin/activate && python3 [script-name]"`
7. WHEN any Python execution fails with module import errors THEN the developer SHALL verify they are using the correct WSL + venv + python3 pattern
